## Getting Started

Another project that I started along with a friend but never really went forward.

The app consisted of an web3 authentication mechanism for any kind of online community, where administrators could create "token gates", which specific requirements, like x number of a token and a NFT of a given collection, for example.

You can see it live [here](https://gandalf-e3w7uzat5-marcoskichel.vercel.app/), just click the CTA and social login (username and password are not implemented), also dont mind the different project names all over the place, its just me being indecisive.
